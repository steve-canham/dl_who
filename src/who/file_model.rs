The workflow to achieve this involves benchtop testing of Nutromics aptamer sensors in buffer and/or biofluid with a known concentration of vancomcyin across a range of temperatures anticipated in-vivo (30-42C). Addition of known values of vancomycin and subsequent measurements. Fitting a calibration equation, and finally using data collected from the device (electrochemical measurements & temperature measurements) in this equation to predict concentration.  <br><br>Limit of Blank will be reported using the predicted mean concentration + 2 standard deviations for a given device’s data ( during the first and last hour of data collection.  <br> 24 hour wear period.];To assess the Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Nutromics Sensor Device regarding its performance and stability over extended periods of wear. This includes evaluating any potential degradation in accuracy or precision of the measurements when the Nutromics Sensor Device is used continuously over a long duration.[The accuracy of the device from interstitial fluid measurements will be assessed as the deviation of vancomycin concentrations from 0 mg/L. The precision will be assessed as the variability (standard deviation) of vancomycin concentrations (if detected) over the 24-hour duration of the study. <br> Across wear period where the Nutromics Sensor Device will collect data on vancomycin concentrations in interstitial fluid every 5 minutes.]""",
